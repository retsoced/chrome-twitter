# Sample Amazon Twitter Feed Extension

Simple Twitter feed widget made as a chrome extension to insert recent feeds into Amazon.com Sidebar.

### Notes

The Dynamic insertion of the Sidebar Ad (#desktop-unrec-ad) continued to give me fits during execution of the code for the extension.
I never did find a good solution to get the twitter feed to display below the ad and also push the other ad down further on the page.
